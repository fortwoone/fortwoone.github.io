            <h3>A clone of Stardew Valley, except not all that much...</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>Released on : 2025/02/02 (UZH study) / TBA (general public) - Role: Game Developer, Quality Analyst</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you know how Stardew Valley works, it's basically the same at first, but simplified, so skip to the next paragraph.

                If you don't, here is a summed-up explanation: it's a farm life simulation, i.e. you get to plant vegetables and various cereals
                and harvest their crops for your living. Additional activities include chatting with NPCs and forming bonds with them, fishing, cooking, etc...
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In this game, planting crops, selling them and social interactions are the three components retained from Stardew Valley.
                The game's initial idea was pitched by a team of researchers at the Department of Psychology of the University of Zurich,
                Switzerland, and their goal was to focus on social interactions, since their subject of research was
                <span class="bold">social influence and its effect on protective health behaviours</span>. As a result, interacting with NPCs
                is a key component of this game, and multiple events may introduce new good health practices during gameplay. Following said
                practices is at the player's discretion, and so is choosing which group to join (you might choose not to join any group at all).

                The project had started months prior to my inclusion, but at the time, the lead researchers did not ask for volunteers.
                It was only in June 2024 that they started looking for volunteer programmers for their project, and I joined the project
                after seeing an ad for it on Discord. As a result, I spent most of my summer working remotely for that project alongside
                the holidays. As of February 4th, 2025, this game has been tested by players in the course of said study, though telemetry
                was not used yet and testing was only just started.
