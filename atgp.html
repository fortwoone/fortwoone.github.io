            <h3>Just your average off-the-mill platformer. Obviously.</h3>

                You actually took time to come here? Well, I have to admit you're persistent. After all, it's not like this
                game is buggy, or anything. Just don't try to hit spikes. They say colliding with one is a surefire way to crash your game...
                but that's as good a feature as anything. Right?
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was made during the <a href="https://www.pythondiscord.com/events/code-jams/9/">Python Discord Summer Code Jam in 2022</a>.
                We were randomly assigned to teams of five people, and we needed to make the game in 10 days. The theme for this jam was
                "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" (hence the subtle title and presentation). I pitched the game idea and programmed the game engine,
                though I had to help from the sidelines on the last day before submitting due to personal reasons. We also had to implement WebSockets
                in this CodeJam, which is why we decided to add online gameplay (the servers are sadly no longer up anymore) and focus the level design
                around multiplayer.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Totally Generic Platformer got in the <span class="bold_paragraph">top 10</span> of the Code Jam (the judges did not give actual rankings to projects under
                the 3rd place, so I can't provide a more precise rank), and the game is still available as of today.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to try it, install the game from <a href="https://github.com/smileyface12349/old-fashioned-orcs/tree/no-online">the no-online branch on the GitHub repository</a>.
                This version has been stripped of its online gameplay, due to the servers not being up, but you can still check out the original versions :
            </p>
            <ul class="no_list">
                <li><a href="https://github.com/smileyface12349/old-fashioned-orcs">Original version from the Code Jam</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/smileyface12349/old-fashioned-orcs/tree/after-jam">Slightly updated version, committed a few months later</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The latter of the two versions has been used as a base for the no-online version.
