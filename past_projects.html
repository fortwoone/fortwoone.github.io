            <h2>My past projects</h2>
            <p>
                I got hooked to coding back in 2017, and I couldn't stop ever since. I worked with quite a few languages over the years,
                namely :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python (2017-present)</li>
                <li>Scratch (2018-2019)</li>
                <li>C++ (2022-present)</li>
                <li>Ada (2023-present, during school)</li>
                <li>HTML (2021-present, during school)</li>
                <li>CSS (2021-present, during school)</li>
                <li>JavaScript (2021-present, during school)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With the exception of the former two, I am still learning and honing my skills with all of these languages.
            </p>
