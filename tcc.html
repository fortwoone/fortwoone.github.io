            <h4>Released on : 2019/04/14 - Role in the game : Made everything (bar standard Scratch assets and SFX)</h4>

                Well, THAT's a fine mess... <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/ScratchCat">Scratchy</a> (aka the Scratch Cat) was about to turn on his computer when he got a nasty surprise...
                It was infected! And so he got sucked inside his own computer!
            </p>
            <p>
                Control Scratchy in a text-based adventure to get out of his own computer!
            </p>
            <p>
                This game was started during a coding event in June 2018. It was my first project ever, and I learned how to write
                a story, as well as the bases of coding, during this game's development. It's available in both French and English, so you can test it here :

            <ul class="no_list">
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/302522326/">Original French version</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/316726023/">English translation</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                A sequel for this game was originally planned. Its development had started a few days after this game's completion, but it was never
                finished. After a year of development of the cancelled sequel, I eventually got tired of Scratch and eventually turned away from it.
                You can test the unfinished project <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/316987453/">here</a> (beware, it was NOT translated).
