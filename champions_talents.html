            <p>This project is meant to help beginner LoL players choose their champion based on the champion stats and their preferred position in a team.
                With Champion's Talents, you will be able to see a comprehensive and exhaustive list of the champions' stats in the game, and have a list of preferred champions depending on the position you want!
                Notably, you will be able to choose the champion either from the whole list or by team position.

                Since the project has just started, there is no download link for the software yet.
